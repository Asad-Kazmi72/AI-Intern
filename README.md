🤖 Task 1: My AI Chatbot 🚀



I have an exciting news for you all! 🎉 



As an AI Intern at CodSoft, I've crafted a chatbot that responds to user input with predefined rules. 💬🤖 



🤖 Chatbot Name: AIAssistantBot



🎯 Objective: Offer helpful responses based on predefined rules.



📜 Predefined Rules:



1. Start the conversation with a friendly greeting.



2. Respond to common greetings like "Hello" and "Hi" with a corresponding greeting.



3. Handle weather inquiries with a static response due to limited access to real-time data.



4. Share the current time when asked.



5. Provide supportive messages when users express emotions like sadness or happiness.



6. Bid farewell gracefully when the user decides to end the conversation.



🤝 I'm excited to continue exploring the world of AI and chatbots. Stay tuned for more updates and insights! Feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts. Let's chat about the future of AI! 🤖💬🚀

🎮 Task 2: Master Tic-Tac-Toe with Unbeatable AI: No Alpha-Beta Pruning 🤖



Another Project from My Internship at CodSoft Completed! 



During my internship, I created a smart AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe without using Alpha-Beta Pruning. Here's how it works in simple steps:



1️⃣ Game Setup: We built a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board and introduced our players, X and O.



2️⃣ See the Game: I added a cool feature to display the game board.



3️⃣ Win or Draw?: The AI knows when there's a winner or a thrilling draw.



4️⃣ Minimax Magic: Our AI uses the Minimax algorithm to find the best moves for player X.



5️⃣ AI's Move: With Minimax calculations, our AI makes smart moves.



6️⃣ Game On: You can play against the AI in the command prompt.



🚀 It's a fantastic journey into AI and gaming, and there's more to come. Stay tuned as I explore even smarter AI optimizations! 🕹️🏆
